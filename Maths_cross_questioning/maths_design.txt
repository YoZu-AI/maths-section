Sure, let's start by using the identity for tangent of the sum of two angles:

tan(A + B) = (tanA + tanB) / (1 - tanA tanB)

We can substitute the given values to get:

√3 = (tanA + tanB) / (1 - tanA tanB)

Similarly, we can use the identity for tangent of the difference of two angles:

tan(A - B) = (tanA - tanB) / (1 + tanA tanB)

Substituting the given values, we get:

1/√3 = (tanA - tanB) / (1 + tanA tanB)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to get the values of tanA and tanB. Adding the two equations, we get:

√3 + 1/√3 = 2tanA / (1 - tanA tanB)

Simplifying, we get:

tanA tanB = (3 - √3) / (3 + √3)

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

√3 - 1/√3 = 2tanB / (1 - tanA tanB)

Simplifying, we get:

tanA + tanB = (√3 + 1/√3) / (1 - tanA tanB)

We can now substitute the value of tanA tanB from the first equation to get:

tanA + tanB = (√3 + 1/√3) / (1 - (3 - √3) / (3 + √3))

Simplifying, we get:

tanA + tanB = 2√3

We can now solve these two equations simultaneously to get the values of tanA and tanB. Using the quadratic formula, we get:

tanA = (√3 + 1) / 2 and tanB = (√3 - 1) / 2

We know that A > B, so we can use the inverse tangent function to get:

A = 60° and B = 30°

Therefore, the values of A and B are 60° and 30°, respectively.

    #The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many loaves of bread did they have left?
    loaves_baked = 200
    loaves_sold_morning = 93
    loaves_sold_afternoon = 39
    loaves_returned = 6
    loaves_left = loaves_baked - loaves_sold_morning - loaves_sold_afternoon + loaves_returned
    result = loaves_left
    print(result)

Do you understand the solution? Do you need a similar example? Or do you know the subtopics?
